    <p>
        Programming for the GBA is cool because you're working so close to the hardware
        - it's really just manipulating bits and registers. For example, here's all you
        need to draw a pixel in the screen:
    </p>
    
    <div><pre><code class="language-clike">
#define REG_DISPCNT 0x4000000
#define REG_VRAM    0x6000000

#define MODE_3 0x3
#define BG2_ENABLE 0x400

#define SCREEN_WIDTH  240
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 160

int main(void)
{
    int x = SCREEN_WIDTH/2;
    int y = SCREEN_HEIGHT/2;

    *(unsigned int *)REG_DISPCNT = MODE_3 | BG2_ENABLE;
    
    ((unsigned short *)REG_VRAM)[y*SCREEN_WIDTH+x] = 0xFFFF;
    
    for(;;){}
    
    return 0;
}</code></pre></div>

    <p>
    In addition, there's a ton of hardware documentation available - for example
    <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm">GBATek</a> as well as programming
    tutorials out there on the web.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Environment</h2>
    <p>
        There are a couple of different dev kits/compilers to choose from when it comes to the GBA
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://devkitadv.sourceforge.net/">DevkitAdvance</a> - One of the older SDKs to my knowledge
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://www.cameronjtinker.com/post/2013/09/30/GBA-Development-with-HAM-271-SDK-for-Windows.aspx">
            Ham SDK
        </a>
        - Comes with an IDE, and is used in Jonothan Harbor's GBA programming book I've been following along with.
        I remember it giving me an issue in Windows 7 though. According to the link you should install it in 
        Windows XP on a virtual machine or whatevs. Also this SDK comes with gfx2gba which I prefer as an image
        converter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/devkitPro">DevkitPro</a> - A newer and actively maintained SDK which 
        has libraries for not only the GBA, but the Nintendo DS, Playstation Portable, Wii, Gamecube, GP32,
        GP2X and the Nintendo Switch. This is the one I have been using, and works in both Windows and Linux.
        Installation is also super easy.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Running/Debugging</h2>
    <p>
        If you have a GBA (which I don't!) You can get a re-writable GBA cartridge to test your games on real 
        hardware with, but I haven't looked too deep into that. Thus, I've been using an emulator -
        <a href="https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m">Visual Boy Advance</a>. Another
        really good emulator with a bunch of debugging features is <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm">
        no$gba</a>. The reason I've been using Visual Boy Advance is that some (all?) versions support
        remote debugging via GDB. (TODO - add usage/example/image of remote debugging here!)
